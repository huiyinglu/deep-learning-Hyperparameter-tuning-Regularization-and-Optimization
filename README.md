There are 5 files in this repository:

  1. Initialization - Implemented different ways to initialize weights and compare the result. (3-layer NN with zeros initialization, 3
  layer NN with large random initialization, 3-layer NN with He (small random initialization) initialization)

  2. Regularization - a) Added L2-regularization to cost and backward propagation of DNN model and compare result. b) Added Dropout in
  forward and backward propagation path of DNN model and compare result.

  3. Gradient Checking - Perform Gradient checking on backward propagation path to proof gradient (derivatives) are calculated correctly.
  (Assume forward propagation and cost is calculated correctly).

  4. Optimization Methods - Implement different optimization algorithms and compare result. (Gradient Descent, Mini-Batch Gradient descent,
  Momentum, Adam).

  5. TensorFlow Tutorial - Use TensorFlow framework to implement a DNN for classifying 6 signs representing 5 different numbers. (subset of
  SIGNS dataset) Model includes the following functions:
  
    a) Create placeholders.
    b) Initialize parameters.
    c) Implement forward propagation.
    d) Compute cost.
    e) Define optimizer to minimize cost
    f) Run the session with certain epochs with defined batch-size (mini-batch).
    g) Calculated accuracy for predictions.
